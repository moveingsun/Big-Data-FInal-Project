# About model.out File
It is the train result file from speaker recognition and it will also be used in speech recognition. But github has a file size limit which is smaller than 25 MB. The big Model.out file is much larger, it cannot be uploaded to github. When training the audio set in local pc, the Model.out file will be updated. 

# Others
audio_class.py train-class.py train-speaker-model.py microphone-class.py are used for past test. They are not used in the actual running time. microphone_recognition.py and audio_transcribe.py are used for previous non-gui environment which uses command line to run it. audio_final and microphone_recognition_final.py are used for gui in PYQT5.

Instruction and report are in the doc folder.
