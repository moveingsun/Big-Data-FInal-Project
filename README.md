# About model.out File
It is the train result file from speaker recognition and it will also be used in speech recognition. But github has a file size limit which is smaller than 25 MB. The big Model.out file is much larger, it cannot be uploaded to github. When training the audio set in local pc, the Model.out file will be updated.
